This thesis covers the process of re-implementing the server application in the Java programming language, building an Arduino-based robot, designing and developing a \acrfull{gui}, as well as updating the wireless communication using Bluetooth Smart and developing software for the server's communication unit. The thesis is a part of a threefold system, and together with two other theses it forms the ``\acrfull{ssnar}''.

Thon (2016) covers the development of the system's simulator, the navigation and path planning, as well as the mapping of discovered area. Ese (2016) provides information about improving the physical robots, developing of the robot's communication unit, as well as developing of the robot's real-time OS, with all of its features.

The thesis consists of three parts. The first part, ``Introduction and Theoretical Basis'', provides information about background history, previous work, the objectives of the report and relevant theory for the thesis. Part two, ``Material, Methods and Results'', includes a list over used material (both software and hardware), and is further divided into chapters that cover both methods and results for the different parts of the system. The final part, ``Discussion, Conclusion and Future Work'', discusses and concludes over the results, and provides some suggestions for future work based on the findings in this thesis.
