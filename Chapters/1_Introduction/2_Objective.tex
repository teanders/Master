\section{Objective}
The objective of this thesis is to re-implement the functionality of the existing solution in a new server application, using a more suitable programming language, to build a robot based on a new type of microcomputer, as well as to update the wireless communication between robots and server using state-of-the-art technology. 

\minisection{Server Application}
The new server application should provide real-time features as well as be able to control several robots at the same time. In addition, the application should:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement the functionality from the existing solution.
    \item Have a system structure that is formed by modules, thus facilitating future work.
    \item Include a \acrlong{gui} that presents the system's functionality in a more user-friendly way.
\end{itemize}

\minisection{Robot}
The new robot should add to the existing collection of robots, and should implement the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Same sensors as existing robots.
    \item Arduino as microcomputer.
    \item Ese (2016) real-time OS.
    \item The new wireless communication standard.
\end{itemize}

\minisection{Wireless communication}
In addition to developing a new server application and building a new robot, the group will select a new standard for the system's wireless communication, and develop the server-side software for the new communication.
