Arduino is an open-source platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software, developed at Ivrea Interaction Design Institute  \cite{arduino2}. Its \acrfull{ide} is cross-platform, and the programming environment is easy to use both for inexperienced and experienced programmers.

Arduino programmes may be written in any programming language with a compiler that produces binary machine code, such as C and C$++$ \cite{arduino}. Its core libraries are written in C and C$++$ and is compiled using avr-gcc and AVR Libc \cite{arduinobuild}.
