\section{Programming Platforms}
\label{sec:tProgrammingPlatform}
\textit{There are four different programming languages used in this thesis. The server application is programmed in Java, the communication dongle is programmed in C, the old program was programmed in MATLAB and testing were done on the robot with Arduino IDE. This section provides basic theory about these four programming languages.}
