\section{Programming Platform}
\label{sec:tProgrammingPlatform}
\textit{There are four different programming languages used in this thesis. The server application is programmed in Java and the communication dongle is programmed in C. Whereas the old program was programmed in MATLAB and testing were done on the Arduino robot was done in Arduino. This section provides basic theory around these four programming languages.}
