\subsection{C}
The C programming language was developed by Dennis M. Ritchie and Bell Labs in the early 1970s \cite{clanguage}. The language provides low-level access to memory, making it suitable for programming embedded systems consisting of microcomputers. C is not tied to any particular hardware or system, it is cross-platform. Thus, the programmes will run on any machine that supports C.

C provides a variety of data types and high-level statements such as if-else, switch, while and for. Even though it enables access to memory, it does not provide read/write statements for input and output \cite{cproglang}.
