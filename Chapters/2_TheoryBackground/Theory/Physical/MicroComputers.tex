\subsubsection{Arduino Mega 2560}
There's many different versions of Arduino boards, providing different physical sizes, processors and number of \acrfull{io} \cite{arduinoboards}. 

The Mega 2560 is based on the ATmega2560 and it is an improved update to the Arduino Mega. It provides 54 digital \acrshort{io} pins and 16 analogue input pins. Figure \ref{fig:atmegaPinMap} illustrates the mapping between the Arduino pins and ATmega2560 ports \cite{arduinomega2560}.

\subsubsection{nRF51}
The nRF51-series supports several different protocol stacks including Bluetooth Smart (Bluetooth low energy), ANT and proprietary 2.4GHz protocols. 

The nRF51-dongle is a low-cost USB development dongle; it has six \acrfull{gpio} pins and can be used as a peripheral between computers and robots \cite{nrf51Dongle}.
