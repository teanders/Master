\textit{The following sections provides a list and describes the software and hardware components used in this project}
\section{Software}
\label{sec:software}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Arduino IDE}, described in Section \ref{sec:progplatarduino}.
    \item \textbf{Atmel Studio} (version 7) is an integrated development platform for developing Atmel-based microcontroller applications, by Atmel Corporation. The environment provides write, build and debug functionality for an application written in C/C$++$ or assembly code. Windows is the supported operating system \cite{atmel}. 
    \item \textbf{Eagle} (version 7.5), Easy Applicable Graphical Layout Editor, is a \acrfull{pcb} design software. It provides three modules, where the user can design the schematics, edit the board layout and route the wires manually/automatically. The software is cross-platform and is available both for Windows, Linux and Mac \cite{eagle}.
    \item \textbf{Keil µVison 5} combines source code editing, program debugging, project management and build facilities in one environment. The software provides functionality for building and programming device peripherals \cite{uvision}. µVision can only be installed on Windows.
    \item \textbf{Matlab} (version R2015a), described in Section \ref{sec:matlab}.
    \item \textbf{Microsoft Project} is a project management tool for Windows that let the users plan their project progress in detail. It provides information about scheduled workloads for all the participants and helps to keep progress in the project. Through the software, the team can generate useful illustrations like Gantt diagrams to get a clear presentation of the project development \cite{msproject}. 
    \item \textbf{MicroStation} is a \acrfull{cad} software for producing drawings and documentation, developed by Bentley. The software can e.g. be used to make wiring diagrams for embedded systems \cite{microstation}. Version 8.11 is used in this thesis. MicroStation can only be installed on a Windows computer.
    \item \textbf{NetBeans} is a tool for software development. Installing different plugins let the user write programs in Java, JavaScript, HTML5, C/C$++$ and more. The software is cross-platform and is available for Windows, Linux and Mac and the latest version available is NetBeans IDE 8.1 \cite{netbeans}.
    \item \textbf{nrfGoStudio} is a Windows application, developed by Nordic Semiconductor, which eases development when using the nRFgo Development kit. The software provides a visual editor and functionality for configuring and programming nRF51-devices \cite{nrfgo}.
    \item \textbf{SolidWorks} is a modelling \acrshort{cad} software, developed by Dassault Systèmes. It provides functionality for design, simulation and publishing of 3D-modelled figures. Windows is the supported operating system \cite{solidworks}.
    \item \textbf{Source Tree} is a free client for Git and Mercurial projects. It provides a straightforward graphical user interface and makes it easy to manage projects \cite{sourcetree}. It can be installed on both Mac and Windows.
