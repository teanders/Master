\section{Programming the nRF51-dongle}
\textit{This section covers the programming of the nRF51-server dongle. For information about the programming of the nRF51-peripherals, see Erlend Ese (2016).}

\subsection{Requirements}
\label{sec:nrfrequirements}
To program the nRF51-dongles, the following software has to be downloaded and installed:
\begin{itemize}
	\item nRF51 SDK10\cite{nrf51sdk}
	\item nRFgo Studio v1.21\cite{nrfgo}
	\item Keil MDK-ARM v5.20\cite{keil}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Setting up the nRF51-dongle}

Having installed all the software listed in Section \ref{sec:nrfrequirements}, the following procedure has to be followed to flash the dongle and prepare it for programming:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Plug in the nRF51-dongle to one of the external USB-ports at the computer.
	\item Start nRFgo Studio, and choose the desired device in the ``Device Manager''-list.
	\item Click ``Erase all''.
	\item Then choose the ``Program SoftDevice''-pane in the right panel and click ``Browse...''.
	\item Navigate to ``[yourDestination]/nrf51\_sdk10/components/softdevice/s130/hex'' and choose the ``s130\_nrf51\_x.x.x\_softdevice''.
