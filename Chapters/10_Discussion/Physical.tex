\section{Arduino Robot}
The Arduino robot is built with the same specs as the AVR robot; it has the same wheels, gears, \acrshort{ir} sensors and tower, compass, gyroscope and the same charging mekanism. What differs from the AVR robot is the wheel encoders, the motor controller, the motors, the ability to turn of charging towers and ofcourse the arduino microcontroller with the selfmade \acrshort{pcb} shield.
