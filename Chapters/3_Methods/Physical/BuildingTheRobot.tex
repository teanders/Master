\subsection{Building the robot}
The robot design were planned out during the first week of the project \textit{(var egentlig andre uke, men er f√∏rste uke om vi tar med at vi startet den 11.jan)}. It was important to order all necessary parts as soon as possible as shipping time can be large when ordering from across the planet..
\subsubsection{Assembly}
The robot chassis consists of two parts which can be separated into the top and bottom.

The battery, wheels and IMU is all mounted at the bottom part. To make the car turn around its own axis, the best placement for the two wheels was in the exact middle of the car. The IMU is placed right between the two wheels.
