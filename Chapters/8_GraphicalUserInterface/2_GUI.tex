\section{Programming the Graphical User Interface}
\label{secr:proggui}
The \acrshort{gui} was programmed and designed in Netbeans \ref{sec:software}, since Netbeans offers a very intuitive \acrshort{gui} builder for Java applications. Netbeans generates a .form file in additional to the normal .java file, the .form file is encoded in XML and contains all parameters the \acrshort{gui} builder needs. When designing a GUI in Netbeans the user do not need to worry about the .form file, as Netbeans does all the work. Netbeans will automatically recognise a Netbeans project and the load .java and .form files together, because of this different users can easily modify the existing project.

The \acrshort{gui} is initialised by calling \textit{new MainGUI(this)} from the class Application, and MainGUI has the responsibility of initializing the rest of the \acrshort{gui}. There is a total of 9 java classes in the GUI package, where 8 of them are extending JFrame and one extending JPanel. Detailed information about the classes can be found in the Javadoc, see Appendix \ref{app:javadoc}.
