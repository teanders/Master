\section{The Final Product}
\label{secr:finprodgui}
The final product can be viewed in Figure \ref{img:mainWindowFinal}, which shows the main window. In this figure, there are two simulated robots (Arduino and Atmel) driving around in a simulated world. The GUI that controls the simulation can be opened by pressing the menu ``Window'' and then ``Simulator''. For more information about the Simulator GUI, please refer to Thon (2016).

The main \acrshort{gui} is divided into seven parts as illustrated by Figure \ref{img:mainWindowFinal}. Objects that have similar functions are grouped together, and the different groups are separated by borders. The \acrshort{gui} is created with the Gestalt Principles (Section \ref{sec:gestaltprinciples}) and Schneiderman's 8 golden rules (Section \ref{sec:schneiderman}) in mind, and if anything is unclear the user can press the menu-item ``Help'' and then ``User manual'', which will open the user manual in the default PDF viewer. The user manual can be found in Appendix \ref{app:userman}, and it provides information about every function in the user interface.

In the following list, the parts of the main window are described:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Menu bar - The menu provides mode-specific functionality, as well as a help menu where the user manual can be found.
    \item Mode title - This panel tells you which mode the program is currently running in.
    \item Connected Robots - This panel will be updated with the connected robots. Clicking the ``Info'' button will open up the Robot info window.
    \item Connect robots - This button will open up the ``Connect Robots'' window.
    \item Start/Stop - The start and stop buttons will start and stop the application. The indicator will light green if the program is running.
    \item Map - The map will be painted in real-time as the robots discover new areas.
    \item Info - The information panel will display informative text as the mouse cursor hovers over the different parts of the \acrshort{gui}.
\end{enumerate}

Figure \ref{fig:guiflow} illustrates the navigation through the different parts of the final \acrshort{gui}. After choosing a mode, the mode-specific window opens. Clicking ``Connect robots'' brings up the related window, and as the scan finishes, the available robots gets listed. After selecting the desired robot(s) and clicking ``Connect'', the communication with the robot(s) is established the server receives a handshake message from the robot(s) confirming the connection. Furthermore, the user sets the initial values for the specific robots, and after the values are set, clicking ``Start'' will initialize the mapping.
