Figure \ref{fig:umlapplication} shows the \acrfull{uml} diagram of the ``Application'' package. As seen in the figure, the package consists of the three classes ``Application'', ``RobotController'' and ``Installer''.

\textit{Installer}  
The ``Installer'' class' method ``generateSystemDependantLibraries'' generates and moves libraries that are necessary for the computer to run the application to the root folder of the application. Since the software uses serial communication, some library files (``.dll''(Windows), ``.jnilib''(Mac OS)) has to be present to for instance be able to open and close COM-ports.
