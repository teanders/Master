\section{Functionality}
\minisection{Cross-platform}
The server application in its entirety is written in the Java programming language, which makes the software able to be run on any device that has the \acrlong{jvm}. Because Java applications are compiled before runtime, the server application will not be as demanding as applications that are compiled runtime. 

\minisection{Connecting to N-robots}
The software is developed in a way that each robot that is connected to the system has one object of the class Robot connected to it, which means that as long as the computer can add another instance of the class Robot, it can connect to more robots. 

\minisection{Real-time plots of discovered areas}
The robots attached to the system sends update messages every 500ms, and the information extracted from the messages is processed and plotted on the map presented in the GUI, which means that the user will be able to see the mapping progress in real-time.
