\section{Designing the System Architecture}
To start off the system design, the group acquired reports and code from the previous projects. By reading the code, testing the functionality and studying the reports the group got an overview and an understanding of the existing system. It was important to know the current system before starting to develop the new system, and therefore, the group used two full weeks to study it.

Initially, the group defined the scope of the new system, the system should:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Inherit the functionality from the existing system.
    \item Be stable and not introduce bugs.
    \item Present mapped data in an easily and understandable way.
    \item Provide a user-friendly \acrshort{gui}.
    \item Be easy to understand and improve in future projects.
\end{itemize}
The list of system goals laid a basis for the system named ``System for Self-Navigating Autonomous Robots'', henceforth referred to as \acrshort{ssnar}.

One of the primary goals was to develop the system in a way that makes it easy to understand for groups that want to improve the system in future projects. The group had object-oriented programming in mind in every part of the system design process,  and the system was divided into subsystems and packages that took care of different areas of responsibility and functionality. Figure \ref{fig:brainstorming} shows how the group was thinking during the brainstorming, trying to structure the responsibilities into modules. 

Subsequently, classes were defined in each module. According to the naming conventions in ``Code Complete'' \cite{stevemcconnell2004}, see Section \ref{sec:nameconv}, the classes were named according to their responsibilities with self-explanatory names, making them easy to understand without having to read their code. Furthermore, the classes routines were defined. All of the routines were designed to do one thing and one thing only, for facilitating high cohesion and low coupling, as described in Section \ref{sec:softconstruct}.

Throughout the developing, the group held coordination meetings with both Ese (2016) and Thon (2016) to make sure the system was designed in the best way possible.
